# Stack Implementation Assignment

This project involves implementing a Stack Abstract Data Type (ADT) using object-oriented programming principles in C++. The Stack should follow a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) approach using linked list structures. It includes operations for pushing, popping, peeking, and checking if the stack is empty.

## Project Structure
- `main.h` : Contains directives for the main program.
- `main.cpp` : Contains the `main` function to test the stack implementation.
- `stack.h` : Contains the Stack class definition and method prototypes.
- `stack.cpp` : Contains the implementation of the Stack class.

## Best Practices
- **Encapsulation**: Stack attributes are private and only accessible through public methods.
- **Loose Coupling**: The Stack class is modular and self-contained.
- **Descriptive Naming**: All class names and method names follow a clear naming convention.
